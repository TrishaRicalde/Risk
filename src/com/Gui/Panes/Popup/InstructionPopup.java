				+ "your opponentâ€™s armies. Successfully winning battles depends on careful planning "
				+ "and bold moves. To win you must attack when the time is right while fortifying your"
				+ " defenses. Each move in Risk is comprised of three phases:"
				+ "\n"
				+ "\n"
				+ "	1. DRAFT: This is where you obtain new armies and can position them strategically\n"
				+ "\n"
				+ "	2. ATTACK: This is where you can attack other territories and take them over \n"
				+ "\n"
				+ "	3. FORTIFY This is where you move soldiers from one territory to another, in order to "
				+ "strengthen your position\n"
				+ "\n", "At the beginning of each turn you will acquire a certain number of troops"
						+ " which you can place in any territory you own, "
						+ "the number of troops you receive depends on a number of factors such as: "
						+ "\n"
						+ "\n"
						+ "	1. The number of territories you occupy\n"
						+ "\n"
						+ "		The number of troops you get for territories is as follows: Number of territories you occupy divided by 3,"
						+ "ignoring any remainder. So if you had 13 territories occupied, you would get 4 troops\n"
						+ "\n"
						+ "	2. The value of the continents you control\n"
						+ "\n"
						+ "		The number of extra armies is different for each continent:\n"
						+ "\n"
						+ "			Asia: 7\n"
						+ "			North America: 5\n"
						+ "			Europe: 5\n"
						+ "			Africa: 3\n"
						+ "			South America: 2\n"
						+ "			Australia: 2\n"
						+ "\n", "After placing your armies at the beginning of your turn, "
								+ "decide if you wish to attack at this time.\n"
								+ "\n"
								+ "The object of an attack is to capture a territory by defeating all the opposing armies already on it."
								+ " The battle is fought by a roll of the dice. Study the board for a moment. Do you want to attack?\n"
								+ "\n"
								+ "If you choose not to attack, click the next button, you may still fortify your position"
								+ " if you wish. If you decide to attack, you must follow these rules: \n"
								+ "\n"
								+ "	1) You may only attack a territory that's adjacent (touching) to one of your own, "
								+ "or connected to it by a dashed line. Examples: Greenland may attack the Northwest Territory, "
								+ "Ontario, Quebec, and Iceland. North Africa may attack Egypt, Western Europe, and Brazil. "
								+ "At the western and eastern edges of the board, Alaska is considered adjacent to and may attack,"
								+ " Kamchatka.\n"
								+ "\n"
								+ "	2) You must always have at least two armies in the territory you're attacking from.\n"
								+ "\n"
								+ "	3) You may continue attacking one territory until you have eliminated all armies on it,"
								+ " or you may shift your attack from one territory to another, attacking each as often as you want"
								+ " and attacking as many territories as you like during one turn.\n"
								+ "\n"
								+ "To Attack: Click both the territory you're attacking and the one you are attacking from and then attack"
								+ "button.\n"
								+ "\n", "No matter what you have done on your turn, you may end your turn by fortifying your position.\n"
										+ "\n"
										+ "Some players refer to this as the \"free move\".\n"
										+ "\n"
										+ "To fortify your position, move as many armies as you would like from one (and only one) of your"
										+ " territories into one (and only one) of your adjacent territories.\n"
										+ "\n"
										+ "Remember to move troops towards borders where they can help in an attack and leave at least one army behind.\n"
										+ "\n"
										+ "", "The winner is the first player to eliminate every opponent by capturing all 42 territories on the board. "
												+ "Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor\n"
												+ "\n" };
