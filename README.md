## Project Proposal: Risk 
A strategy board game of which the objective is to dominate territories. Players have a limited amount of pieces which they can place onto a map. In order to win one must gain control over all the territories on the map. Battles occur when player wish to take over an adjacent territory. The victor of battles between players are determined through the rolling of dice. The amount of dice rolled depends on the number of pieces on a territory. The player with a higher number pieces on a territory has a higher chance defending/attacking territories, but is not guaranteed to win the battle. Thus adding the element of risk.
